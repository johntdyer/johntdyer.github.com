The ELB command line tools are pretty nice, and they are actually required to get a lot of important information which is unfortunately missing from the AWS ELB UI. Installation is actually quite simple, first go ahead and download the zip from here, and then just go ahead and do the following:

{% highlight ruby %}

wget http://ec2-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/ElasticLoadBalancing.zip
unzip ElasticLoadBalancing.zip -d ~/bin
echo "EXPORT ~/bin/`ls ~/bin | grep Elastic`" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
{% endhighlight %}


Then boom, magic

{% highlight bash %}

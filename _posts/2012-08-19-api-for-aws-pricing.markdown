Looking for an easy way to get AWS pricing programitcaially? Just use the following three URIâ€™s to get a JSON feed of transfer costs, as well as Reserved and On-Demand instance pricing:

{% highlight bash %}
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/pricing-on-demand-instances.json
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/pricing-reserved-instances.json
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/pricing-data-transfer.json
{% endhighlight %}

Enjoy
